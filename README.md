# CPP-Stack-Handler
This project was made purely for practice purposes. Nothing too serious. A basic Stack Handler project that was made in approximately 30 minutes.
Also, if you're wondering, i re-coded the whole standard stack structure for practice purposes. I am very clear with the fact that the c++ library **<stack>** exists.
